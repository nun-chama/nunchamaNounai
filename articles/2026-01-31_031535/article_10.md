## 概要
**Prompt:**A high-quality, realistic photograph of a young Japanese woman with a neat, short black bob haircut and a warm, friendly smile. She is wearing a classic Japanese school uniform (white sailor-style top with navy blue collar and cuffs featuring white stripes, and a matching navy pleated skirt). **Pose & Composition:**She is in a crouching (squatting) pose against a clean, minimalist white background, looking directly at the camera. She is holding a silver retro electronic device (a vintage handheld digital radio with a small LCD screen and various tactile buttons) in her right hand, positioned next to her face as if presenting it to the viewer. The composition is a full-body or medium-shot that captures the iconic 1990s Japanese idol aesthetic.**Person Details:**Person: The right ear is exposed, and black bangs flow to the left, covering only the left half of the forehead. A straight, short bob with a neck length. She is a thin Japanese woman with large almond-shaped eyes, a small oval face, and a beautiful, archaic demeanor.**Technical Details:**Soft, even studio lighting, sharp focus on the woman's face and the electronic device, realistic skin textures, high resolution, 8k, authentic photographic style.続きをみる
